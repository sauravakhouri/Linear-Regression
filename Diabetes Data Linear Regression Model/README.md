# Linear Regression Model built using sklearn on Diabetes dataset.

The Diabetes Dataset is a built-in dataset provided by sklearn

Steps:
1) Loading the data set
2) Identifying the Independent(Predictor) and Dependent(Target) variables
3) Creating X and Y matrices using Predictor and Target Variables
4) Splitting the data into Train and Test and deciding the train and test size
5) Instantiating and creating a Linear Regression model and creating a best fit line using the X and Y train data
6) Applying the trained model to make prediction for Y using X_test data
7) Find out the prediction results slope, intercept, mse, r_square
8) More the r_square, more will be the accuracy of the model, so based on that make changes on train and test size of split
9) Find Adjusted R Square, using which we can eliminate features and decide which ones are helpul for the model accuracy
